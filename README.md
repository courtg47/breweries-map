# Neighborhood Map - Breweries of Birmingham, AL

This project is a single page web app utilizing Google Maps that displays a list of breweries 
in the Birmingham, AL area. Map markers are provided on the map identifying each brewery and the user
may click on a map marker to view the name of the brewery and a Google Street View image of
the location. In addition, a sidebar allows for additional functionality, including displaying an image,
website url, phone number, likes, and hours for each brewery from the Foursquare API. A user may search 
for breweries in the area using a text filter and may also find breweries within a specified distance 
(given a mode of transportation) and have a route to the brewery provided for them. This project satisfies 
the Neighborhood Map project for the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer nanodegree.
